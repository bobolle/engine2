## philosophy and fundamentality

Most modern games nowdays are lacking in complexibility.
Most modern games are too easy going on giving rewards.
Most modern games are too focused on graphics.

I wanna create a game were I can explore the limitations of game mechanics.

I want content to be easily producible.
I NEVER want the game to feel "sluggish".
Loss of frames/crashes is NEVER acceptable.
There have to be a way for user to customize interface and such via lua (like in wow).

## engine structure

I have trouble making up the structure in my mind since I've never done this before.

I want libraries to be self-explainitory after I've created them.
I only want to create game logic using simple function calls.
